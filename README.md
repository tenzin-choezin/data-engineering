# Data Engineering Projects

These are a collection of data engineering projects that I completed as part of UC Berkeley's recently created CS 194 - Data Engineering course. 

An overview of the projects in this repo:
- **sql_exploration.ipynb:** Working with SQL on the IMDB database
- **query_performance.ipynb:** Exploring how the database system optimizes query execution and how users can futher tune the performance of their queries. This project works with the Lahman's Baseball Database, an open source collection of baseball statistics from 1871 to 2020. 
- **data_transformation.ipynb:** Dealing with one month of data from sensors in buildings at UC Berkeley. This is a very typical real-world dataset in that it's kind of a mess.
- **mongo_analysis.ipynb:** Investigating how different database systems handle semi-structured JSON data. In particular, we will be placing emphasis on the use of MongoDB: a database system that stores data in a construct known as documents.
